# AboutMe
Hi
My name’s Yashita I’m a junior and I’m majoring in Computer Science. I choose Digital Humanities because I thought it would be useful class to take if I wanted to become a programmer. Since I started off as a Political Science major, I was already familiar with humanities and liberal arts classes. Sure enough, I am also taking this class to fulfill the writing intensive requirement for the University. When I was younger, I loved writing, and considered it a passion (even though I wasn’t good at it). 
This summer I’m hoping to get a tech internship, so I can get hands on experience working in the industry.
